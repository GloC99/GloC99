# Hey there!

Thanks for checking out my skills section, including the C language. Sadly, there's no official website for C yet, but I couldn't leave the link empty - that would be like a dangling pointer. To avoid leaving an awkward blank space, I decided to add a little placeholder page.

While you're here, why not check out some of my writing examples from [here](https://github.com/GloC99/Reports-and-Presentations "Reports and Presentations")? I guarantee they're more exciting than a buffer overflow. Personally, I'm pretty proud of [this one](https://github.com/GloC99/Reports-and-Presentations/blob/main/Data-Querying/Explore-the-effectiveness-and-efficiency-of-SPARQL-query-in-DBpedia.pdf "Explore the effectiveness and efficiency of SPARQL query in DBpedia") about the efficiency of SPARQL queries in DBpedia - it's a real page-turner, I promise.

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
